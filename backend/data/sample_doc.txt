Welcome to the RAG Bot Demo

This is a sample document to demonstrate the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities of this chatbot.

The RAG bot can answer questions based on the content in this document and any other documents you add to the data folder.

Key Features:
- Document ingestion from text, markdown, and PDF files
- Vector embedding using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
- Semantic search using LanceDB vector database
- Question answering using GPT-3.5-turbo
- Source citation in responses

How it works:
1. Documents are split into chunks and embedded
2. User queries are embedded using the same model
3. Similar document chunks are retrieved via vector search
4. The language model generates responses based on retrieved context

This demo showcases how to build a knowledge-based chatbot that can provide accurate, contextual answers from your document collection.
